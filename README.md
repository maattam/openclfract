Openclfract
============

## Fractal rendering using OpenCL and OpenGL interop

Openclfract allows the user to explore the mandelbrot set. The fractal is generated by an OpenCL kernel,
which outputs the image to a pre-allocated OpenGL texture. The texture is displayed on screen by drawing a
texture screen-oriented quad.
